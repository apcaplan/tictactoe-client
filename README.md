This game was designed and coded by Adam Caplan, as part of a project for General Assembly.

The code is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and makes use of the jQuery library, Bootstrap toolkit, AJAX, and JSON.

I began this project by building a basic gameboard and coding simple game functions. Then I created sign up, sign in, change password, and logout features, and connected all to an API provided by General Assembly. With these authentications in place, I connected gameplay to the API so that each game would be logged on the server, and the app would update the stored information with each move. When the game was fully functional, I began styling and debugging. This process will contiue in the next version...

Look forward to future versions with improved styling and more features, including games won reporting, a two-player option, and an option to play against the computer!
