This game was designed and coded by Adam Caplan, as part of a project for General Assembly.

The code is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and makes use of the jQuery library, Bootstrap toolkit, AJAX, and JSON.

Look forward to future versions with improved styling, a two-player option, and an option to play against the computer!
